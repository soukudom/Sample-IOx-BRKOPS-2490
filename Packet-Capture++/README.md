# How to build the code
Installation instructions and build packages are available [here](https://github.com/FETA-Project/TrafficCaptureInfrastructure/tree/main). For packages please check the Release section. 

If you would like to learn how to build basic docker image, please check the sample app for Catalyst 9000 or Catalyst 9100 

Note: To make packet capture alive you need to mirror the traffic to the IOx application (TCI Drone). The same is valid for example for CyberVision. Please configure ERSPAN in the IOS-XE. The example is in the `erspan-config.txt`.

# Install via Catalyst Center
